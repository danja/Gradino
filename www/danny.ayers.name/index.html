<h3>Current Activities</h3>
 

<ul class="heading">
  <li>Programming, R&amp;D, Semantic Web Outreach</li>
</ul>
 
<p>I currently work part-time for <a href="http://talis.com/" >Talis</a>, around applications and evangelism of their hosted Semantic Web Platform.</p>
 
<p>R&amp;D activities include experimenting with an agile approach to
Semantic Web application development using an agent-oriented paradigm. </p>
<ul class="heading">
  <li>Technical Writing</li>
</ul>
 
<p>For several years I worked as a freelance writer, co-authoring 10
technical books mostly on Web technologies. Nowadays I generally only
write short pieces, including an irregular column ("Webscience") for IEEE
Internet Computing. </p>
 
<ul class="heading">
  <li>Community Work, Conferences</li>
</ul>
 
<p>@@TODO</p>
 
<p>occasional speaking, standards work, programme committees etc : SWIG, SWEO, GRDDL, </p>
 
<p>EC reviewer</p>
 
<ul class="heading">
  <li>Weblogs</li>
</ul>
 
<p>I've had a <a href="http://dannyayers.com/" >personal blog</a> for many years. I tend to post a lot on Semantic Web-related matters. </p>
 
<p>@@TODO add Talis stuff</p>
 
<p>I'm a very occasional contributor to <a href="http://lambda.weblogs.com/">Lambda the Ultimate</a> <em>the</em>
programming languages weblog (usually when a new RDF serialization appears).</p>
 
<h3>Personal Stuff</h3>
 
<p>I live in rural northern Italy. I moved here around 2001 with my
wife Caroline, sadly she died suddenly in July 2008. I'm originally
from the <a href="http://www.cressbrook.co.uk/" >Peak District</a> in northern England, (Caroline was from <a href="http://www.cressbrook.co.uk/bakewell.htm" >Bakewell</a>, me from <a href="http://www.tideswellonline.com/html/about.htm" >Tidza</a> ). We lived in <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/indian_subcontinent/sri_lanka/" >Sri Lanka</a> for a while before settling here. I've got two dogs and three cats.</p>
 
<p>You'll have gathered I'm a developer, tech author and consultant, on forward-looking Web technologies. I <em>enjoy</em> this stuff.</p>
 
<p>I also enjoy making music - I was a founder member of <a href="http://www.earthlydelights.co.uk/discog.html" >Nocturnal Emissions</a>,
way back, but didn't do anything for many years. I'm hoping to release
a CD of work by myself and Caroline sometime soon. I very much like
carving wood, and since being near the Carrera marble quarries (as in
the photo left) I've started trying stone. I'll have another crack at
oil painting when time permits, it seems you need practice to get
beyond blobby trees. I'm not remotely athletic but did try skiing once,
a lot of fun despite the bruises. I've spent a lot of time plodding up
hills on foot, being dragged by the dogs.</p>

  <li>Some History</li>
</ul>
 
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/pet.htm" >My first computer was one of these:</a></p>
 
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/pet.htm"><img src="danny_files/commodore_pet2001_tiny.html" title="My first computer, a PET 2001" alt="little old computer" height="53" width="60"/></a></p>
 
<p>I've been interested in knowledge representation and machine learning for
many years and have worked for several years on network technologies. I'm
delighted to see these fields are now converging before my very eyes, in the
form of the Web, soon to be formerly known as the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web</a>. I got interested in these
particular technologies while trying to build a smarter search engine, quite <a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind9906&amp;L=rdf-dev&amp;P=R21&amp;I=-1">a
while ago</a> now.</p>
 
<p>I'm active on the Web. The earliest material of mine still live I believe is
<a href="http://www.telephone.demon.co.uk/">this</a> from around 1996. Most
things pass through the <a href="http://dannyayers.com/">blog</a> these days (my
earliest bloglike post is probably this <a href="http://dannyayers.com/isacat/lanka/pp0.htm">postcard</a> from around
1999/2000).</p>
 
<p>I haven't really got any paper qualifications, though I had 2 years studying
electronics for the music industry (HND level) and a one-year degree course at
Sheffield Hallam University on Engineering Information Technology, really
enjoying the digital signals material but flunking the finals on analogue
circuit theory. I've also done some of a part-time MSc in Computing for
Commerce and Industry with the Open University, although that's become totally
redundant with the work I've been doing since.</p>
 
<p>I got into distributed computing while working at the University of Derby's
<a href="http://www.highpeak.ac.uk/">Buxton Campus</a> (High Peak College),
where for around 4 years my primary responsibility was looking after a network
(Netware, NT and the obligatory Linux box) serving several hundred staff and
several thousand students. The IT department was a very small team, so I was
also on call for end-user support (I still cringe when the phone rings). At one
point I had the pleasure of redesigning the whole server configuration
essentially single-handedly, I also put together the College's first Intranet
and was behind their initial presence on the Web. Around the same period I was
an invited speaker at the <a href="http://www.mumjava.com/default.asp">MumJava
Conference</a> in Mumbai (Bombay), India. I also did a little teaching at the
College, basic Web stuff and Java.</p>

<h3><strong>Published Work</strong> <a id="published" name="published"></a></h3>

<p>I write an <em>irregular column</em> for IEEE Internet Computing called <a href="http://www.computer.org/search/results?action=authorsearch&amp;resultsPerPage=50&amp;queryOption1=DC_CREATOR&amp;sortOrder=descending&amp;queryText1=Danny%20Ayers">Webscience </a></p>

<p>I've tech reviewed a <em>lot</em> more.</p>
 
<p>I've done a couple of short pieces for O'Reilly's <a href="http://www.xml.com/">xml.com</a> : <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/07/23/extendingrss.html">Extending RSS</a>
and <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/11/19/svgwiki.html">Creating an SVG
Wiki</a></p>
 
<p>In the days before the Web I had several articles published in the magazine
"Electronics World &amp; Wireless World" - on or roundabout non-linear
circuitry. These included a write-up on how easy it was for circuits to get
chaotic, and a bat detector. Two of these articles appeared as the cover
feature of the magazine.</p>
