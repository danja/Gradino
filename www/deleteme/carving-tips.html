<h1>Six Essential Tips for Woodcarving</h1>

<p>I'm by no means an expert woodcarver but have been practicing for long
enough to notice the significance of certain aspects. The following points
stand out, they can make the difference between satisfaction and utter
despondency. </p>

</ol>

<p>They may seem obvious, but that's the big problem, these things are really
easy to overlook. I'm going to print this list out and stick it on the wall, I
suggest you do the same.</p>

<h2>1. <a id="Plan">Plan ahead</a></h2>

<p>Yeah, obvious. But specifically with woodcarving, it really does pay in the
long run to devote plenty of time to planning. First there is making sure
you've got all the tools and materials you're going to need (not forgetting
<strong>superglue and band-aids</strong> for those unintentional cuts in work
and fingers respectively). Even if you're lousy at drawing, rough sketches can
not only focus your mind on the task ahead but also reveal potential problems
ahead of time. There's little worse than spending hours working on something
only to discover a silly oversight that means it won't work.</p>

<p>If you're making something fairly figurative, making a model in plasticine
is a good idea. Any bits that look especially tricky can be tried out on a
piece of scrap. Experiment, experiment, experiment.</p>

<h2>2. <a id="good">Use good quality tools</a></h2>

<p>Good quality essentially means suitable steel and a comfortable handle. </p>

<p>Nothing can be more frustrating than trying to work with bad tools. No
matter how much effort you put in, however careful you are, you'll be lucky to
get good results. </p>

<p><strong>Good quality doesn't necessarily mean expensive</strong>. There are
cheap sets available but beware, often the price is reflected in the quality -
nasty bendy steel that won't hold an edge. Look for a respected maker's name
(When buying new I personally favour Henry Taylor tools, though there are lots
of other good brands around, e.g. Pfeill, Two Cherries etc). While new gouges
usually cost around Â£20 upwards each, second-hand ones can be found at a
fraction of this price (junk shops, yard sales, eBay). As long as there isn't
too much pitting of the metal, even very rusty tools can be resurrected. Tools
that have come from another carver's toolbox are likely to be good, whatever
their age (if you see a personal name stamp on the handle, that's a win). </p>

<p>Smaller tools do tend to be less expensive, but bear in mind it's pretty
straightforward to make your own from masonry nails using a blowtorch and
hammer. With care the quality can be top notch.</p>

<p>What's more, <strong>it's much better to have two or three quality tools
than dozens of poor ones</strong>. Virtually any carving can be done with a
couple of tools. It may take longer than it would having racks of gouges
available, but it's still possible, which it probably won't be with bad tools.
Even if you have racks of gouges, you will tend to use three or four of them
more than any other. It's often easier to make two cuts with a slightly
suboptimal tool than look for the ideal one and make one cut.</p>

<h2>3. <a id="Sharpen">Sharpen well</a></h2>

<p>Yup, sharpen well, sharpen again and keep sharpening. The necessity of
properly sharp tools cannot be overstated. They simply don't work properly
unless they're <strong>razor sharp - <em>literally</em></strong>. While the
steel/temper of carving tools is usually a little less hard than shaving tools
(to avoid destruction by bashing and enable easier resharpening), the required
edge is very much in the same ball park.</p>

<p>It can be seriously tedious getting an fine edge back on a tool that hasn't
been used for a long time. But the effort will be repaid by sheer pleasure when
using it. Also, a little counter-intuitively, <strong>sharp tools are much
safer than blunt ones</strong> because they allow you considerably more
control. Less likelyhood of a blade skidding off into flesh.</p>

<p>It's usually best to try and sharpen all the gouges and knives you expect to
use during a carving session before you start, give them a wipe to remove any
traces of stone and also wash your hands. Once a tool is sharp, it can be kept
sharp by briefly stropping it periodically during the carving session (say
after every 10 or 15 minutes of use of that particular tool). </p>

<p>At the end of a carving session it's a good idea to wipe the tools with an
oily rag and remember to <strong>keep them in a dry place</strong>.</p>

<h2>4. <a id="Support">Support the workpiece securely</a></h2>

<p>As well as control over the cutting tool, you need control of the thing you
are cutting. Traditionally the woodcarver would work standing at a heavy-duty
wooden bench with their work either held in chops, a leg vice or on a screw.
While these approaches are always options, all that really matters is that
<strong>the piece you're working on isn't going anywhere</strong>. This can be
achieved using anything from a carpenter's bench and vice, a solid tray on your
lap with ad hoc wedges or a thick piece of plywood on the kitchen table and a
handful of clamps. Modern screw clamps are really cheap and can work perfectly
well. Every time you visit a tool shop or hardware store, pick up a couple
more. <strong>You can never have too many clamps</strong>.</p>

<h2>5. <a id="aware">Always be aware of the wood's grain</a></h2>

<p>The grain is probably the most important characteristic of a piece of wood
in practical terms. How the blade of a gouge or knife is angled relative to the
grain will determine how the cut proceeds. Cuts in the direction of the grain
take less effort, but have a tendency to slip out of control. Cuts straight
across the grain are harder work but aren't so likely to surprise. However most
cuts will be made between these extremes, at a diagonal at some angle. </p>

<p>[insert diagram(s)]</p>

<p>The grain can be very deceptive. Sometimes it looks like what's needed is
say, to simply use a V tool to cut out a line or curve to outline a form. But
although the grain might be running in a favourable direction for one side of
the V, on the other side it's running exactly wrong, and the result when you
try it is a nasty tear. In fact quite often when you'd ideally like to make a
single, maybe deep groove the grain on one side is angled in a way likely to
cause problems. One trick that can help in such situations is </p>

<p>The stop cut is your friend. In its basic form you make a vertical incision
around where you want your planned cut to end at the depth you're aiming for,
so the wood won't split beyond when you make the actual cut. There are many
variations of this basic technique. For example, say you were carving some
letters in relief, and want to get the background down immediately around the
letters. It may be useful not only to make a vertical stop cut around where the
edge of the letters will be, but also gouge a groove further away from the
letters than the cut you really want to make. This way there's a kind of fire
break on either side of your planned cut, it's much more likely to go the way
you want it to.</p>

<p></p>

<p>While some woods can be easy-going, fairly consistent across different
directions (e.g. basswood, boxwood) others can be really obstinate and prone to
split (e.g. some oak, chestnut). Ideally you should experiment with offcuts of
the piece of wood you're going to be carving, failing that start the work with
really gentle cuts until you get a feel for how it responds.</p>

<h2>6. <a id="patient">Be patient</a></h2>

<p>No matter how slow you feel you are proceeding, you're very unlikely to get
better results by trying to speed up. A true cliche : <strong>more haste less
speed</strong>.</p>

<p>Generally it is better to make a few well-placed cuts rather than a lot of
little ones, it's more efficient and the result is usually more pleasing.
However unless you're pretty sure a particular cut is going to work, the
shave-shave-shave option is preferable to one big screw-up.</p>

<p>Mistakes in themselves may be undesirable, best avoided, but in the great
scheme of things they're positive. <strong>Making mistakes is a great way of
learning</strong>. There's always next time.</p>

<p>If you find yourself starting to make mistakes, take a break. </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Some final thoughts:</strong></p>

<p>Aim for perfection, but be happy if you achieve mediocrity. If you've made
something that didn't exist before, no matter how shabby, that in itself is a
huge achievement.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and <strong>never give up</strong>. Well no, give up if you want
to, it's entirely up to you.</p>
