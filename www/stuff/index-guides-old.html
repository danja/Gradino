<h1>Danny's Guides</h1>

<p><em>not <a href="https://girlguiding.org.uk/">that</a> kind</em></p>

<p>I enjoy making stuff, including Web stuff. Most of the information I've
needed to make stuff has come from the Web. I've also got a terrible memory,
and finding things on the Web can be time-consuming. Altogether it makes sense
for me to write stuff up on the Web. If this material is useful for anyone
else, great. I reckon making stuff is a very good idea, and it's almost always
good fun. Things rarely turn out the way they were planned, on the upside you
can get serendipity, one the downside things can go horribly wrong. But even
that's positive in the long run, mistakes are how you learn. Perfection is
overrated, mediocrity is often satisfying enough.</p>

<p>So this is a list of dedicated write-ups. There may be related material
scattered on my <a href="http://dannyayers.com">blog</a>, for now there's only
search, though I do plan to add cross-linking of some description before very
long.</p>

<p>Each of these documents is based on my own experiences, drawing on other Web
resources for references. I'm not an expert on any of these things, still
learning, so the information is just my best effort at the time of writing.
Expect incomplete, patchy, rambling and incoherent. </p>
