          <h1>Latest Developments</h1>
         <p>This could be titled <strong>Lessons Learned</strong>, though I should make clear at the start that the Vinocaster has turned out to be a wonderful instrument, it's still my main guitar. To <em>almost</em> all intents and purposes it is now finished, although I do want to tweak the wiring/scratchplate a little asap, my current switch setup isn't wonderful.
</p>
<p>Anyhow, <strong>It's a wonderful thing, hindsight.</strong> I've been using the Vinocaster for quite a while now, occasionally making tweaks, and have learnt a few things over this period. In summary, in retrospect I should have :
<ul>
  <li>...waited until I had some transparent epoxy for gluing the body together</li>
  <li>...spent a lot more time getting the finish right first time</li>
  <li>...accepted that this guitar wouldn't produce <em>every</em> sound and focussed on making <em>its own</em> sound good</li>
  <li>...used the Stratocaster's scratchplate design</li>
</ul>
The rest of this page explains.
</p>
<h2>A Universal Guitar isn't a Good Idea</h2>
<p>I wanted the Vinocaster to fulfil all my guitar requirements. As I've since discovered, this was rather wrong-minded. Many different styles of guitar have distinctive sounds, but probably the clearest difference in solid-bodied electrics is that between the Fender style and the Gibson Les Paul style. Basically I'd assumed I could get a guitar built in the Fender style to produce LP sounds simply by strapping on the appropriate pickup (a humbucker). <strong>Nope.</strong></p>
<p>
This was made clear to me when on impulse, I ordered a 115 euro LP copy, a "<a href="http://www.thomann.de/gb/harley_benton_hbl450bk.htm">Harley Benton</a>" (Thomann's own - Chinese? - brand). Previous experience suggested this would be perfectly playable once set up despite slightly sub-standard hardware, the body and neck being acceptable quality, but probably sound poor because of crummy pickups. 
   <a href="images2/preferred/lp.jpg" rel="lightbox" title="Les Paul clone with pickup mod">
      <img alt="Les Paul clone with pickup mod" src="images2/thumbs/lp.jpg" 
           width="100" height="127" align="left" /></a>

So without a thought I replaced the pups with some that appeared more suitable, <a href="http://store.guitarfetish.com/v59clalpazeh.html">GFS "Vintage 59"</a>s. Net result a pretty good sounding low-cost LP clone, ideal for blues/metal.
</p>
<p>
Anyhow it turned out that my assumption that LP-style pickups on the Vinocaster for an LP sound wasn't <em>totally</em> wrong, the choice of pickup does seem to be by far the biggest single influence on the sound. But neither a true (<a href="http://www.tvjones.com/pickups/magnatron.html">TV Jones</a> - <em>I also wanted a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretsch">Gretsch</a> sound!</em>) humbucker in the bridge position nor various combinations of single-coil humbuckers (Seymour Duncan) elsewhere really captured the same feel. So it also seems the physics of the rest of the instrument make a pretty significant contribution. Here's my latest guess at the ranking of the influence of the different factors and their scope for modification:
<ol>
<li>Pickup - relatively easy to change</li>
<li>Pickup placement - slightly harder to change</li>
<li>Scale length - major reconstruction</li>
<li>Hardware - inconvenient to change</li>
<li>Weight/density, body shape etc. - major reconstruction</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h3>Pickups Plan B</h3>
<p>
<em>Which should have been Plan A.</em>
</p>
<h4>Jangle</h4>
<p>
So I decided to still aim for versatility, but now within the bounds of what the Vinocaster seemed good at. Ok, so one guitar sound I quite like is "jangly", and this should be in scope for a Strat-style instrument. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danelectro">Danelectro</a> guitars have a reputation for being particularly jangly, and they use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipstick_pickup"lipstick pickups</a>, so I decided to have a <a href="http://store.guitarfetish.com/6K-Middle-Position-Pro-Tube-Lipstick-Chrome_p_1028.html">GFS lipstick-tube</a> in the middle position. 
</p>
<h4>Transparency</h4>
<p>
I'd read good things about <a href="http://www.lacemusic.com/Alumitone_Single_Coil.php">Lace Alumitone</a> pickups, which are a novel design - the main pickup coil is the (low impedance) aluminium body of the pickup itself whichis hooked to a little transformer. The Alumitone <a href="http://www.thegearpage.net/board/showthread.php?t=545896">reviews</a> use words like "transparent", "wide-band", "hi-fi" and even "sterile". Nothing wrong with "<a href="http://www.earthlydelights.co.uk/archive/sterile/intro.html">sterile</a>"!. For my purposes, also influential was the line <quote>"With a 5-position switch they provide surprisingly very stratty in between tones."</quote>. So I've got one in the neck position. 
</p>
<h4>Twang</h4>
<p>
I've left the <a href="http://www.tvjones.com/pickups/magnatron.html">TV Jones pickup</a> in the bridge position, it's got a great sound. But I did slap my forehead for buying the boring-looking humbucker style form factor rather than the much cooler traditional Gretsch. I can hack the body of this guitar however I want, the pickup shape doesn't matter.
</p>
<h4>Result</h4>
<p>
So I've decided this pickup setup is the final version. Although I can't really imitate an LP with it, that doesn't matter, I now have a separate LP style guitar for that purpose. What I am really happy about is that it does have a very good range of sounds, many quite characteristic to it and hence unique.

           width="100" height="134" align="right" /></a>
I've put the Seymour Duncan pickups I had in the Vinocaster in my (already fairly modded) Squire Strat which now produces a pretty good generic Strat sound, which also happens to be very handy for reference purposes.
