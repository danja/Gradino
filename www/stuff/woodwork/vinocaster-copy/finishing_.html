<h1>Finishing the Vinocaster</h1>

<p>I finally got around to the last bits I wanted to do. Here's the state I'd
left the Vinocaster in after the last phase of work, the wood surface is completely raw:</p>

<p><img alt="Vinocaster, before finishing"

<p>One job that needed doing was to tidy up the nut. Although the slot depths
were as good as I'm likely to be able to get them without special tools (I
used carving knives &amp; needle files to get this far), there was a lot of
surplus above the string that was kind-of in the way.</p>

<p><img alt="Nut, prework" src="images/nut-prework.jpg" /></p>

<p>The middle pickup (a Seymour Duncan Duckbucker) didn't work very well in
this combination (Seymour Duncan Cool Rails and TV Jones Magna'Tron), so I
wanted to replace that. Slightly trickier was what to do about the veneer
scratchplate and control panel. I'd backed them with a smear of epoxy and a
layer of thin copper foil. Although they lasted ok since the last assembly,
it was obvious they were a bit flimsy to stay the course any length of
time.</p>

<p><img alt="Pickups, prework" src="images/pickups-prework.jpg" /></p>

<p>Here's the control panel :</p>

<p><img alt="Control panel" src="images/controls-pre.jpg" /></p>

<p>I also wanted to rearrange the controls a little, the volume control was
still too close to the picking area for my liking (bridge is in the bottom
left corner in this pic).</p>

<p>When I did the initial body shaping I left it quite chunky, in part
because I was impatient but also because I wasn't entirely sure of how I
wanted the shape to go. Basically I wanted to see what it felt like, and get
it to suit my shape as well as possible. I'd modelled the curves on my Squier
Strat, but the body of the Vinocaster is a fair bit thicker. Here's what
turned out to be the most significant part, the top curve was quite
uncomfortable.</p>

<p><img alt="Curve prework" src="images/curve-pre.jpg" /></p>

<p>It was definitely a good idea to use the thing for a couple of months before
finalising the shape. The wood had been polished and gone a little darker
where it'd had a lot of rubbing, which made a handy guide. For example,
though it's not clear on this photo the area where my right arm rested
(uncomfortably) on the lower bout was plain to see.</p>

<p><img alt="Body, raw" src="images/body-raw-2.jpg" /></p>

<p>Here's new hardware I was fitting - locking strap nuts, a proper 5-way
Strat switch and a Fender Lace Sensor pickup (untried by me, I could only go
by what was said online about it).</p>

<p><img alt="New hardware" src="images/new-hardware.jpg" /></p>

<p>So, to work. I started with the body reshaping, using an old spokeshave, a
gouge &amp; mallet and carving knives. The ancient bench Achille next door
has given me on long-term loan was perfect for the job. </p>

<p><img alt="Body shaping" src="images/shaping.jpg" /></p>

<p>Here's the back after shaping and a bit of sanding:</p>

<p><img alt="Back rough" src="images/back-rough.jpg" /></p>

<p>...and here's the back when the sanding was nearly done. I sanded a fair
bit with a small rechargeable vibrating sanding pad thing, continuing by hand
when the battery ran down.</p>

<p><img alt="Back sanded" src="images/back-sanded.jpg" /></p>

<p></p>

<p>When I was reasonably happy with the sanding, I gave it a coat of <em>olio
pagliarino</em> (straw oil?), the stuff they use around here where in the uk
you'd expect to see linseed oil. The stuff doesn't actually set, just soaks
in gradually. I kept the body wet with the stuff for 3 or 4 days.</p>

<p><img alt="Oily back" src="images/back-oily.jpg" /></p>

<p>The wood didn't go quite as dark as I expected, but more honey-coloured, a
pleasing shade. The odd-coloured strip showed up more, but I'm not bothered 
about that.</p>

<p>Here's the front after sanding, the wood actually started to take on a bit
of a sheen before I even got to the oil. I'd also added thin copper foil to
screen the cavities.</p>

<p><img alt="Front sanded" src="images/front-sanded.jpg" /></p>

<p>While the oil was soaking in I had half an hour here and there on other
bits. To strengthen the scratchplate and control panel I decided to back the
veneer with copper sheet (I'd spotted some in the back of the cantina that
looked perfect). I haven't got any tin snips, not sure they'd have been any
good anyhow, the copper was very stiff. So I cut the shapes out using an old
chisel blade and a small lump hammer, nibble, nibble... Here's the control
panel backing in progress:</p>

<p><img alt="cutting copper" src="images/cutting-copper.jpg" /></p>

<p>Here's the scratchplate backing in progress, on the left is the veneer to
which it has to attach.</p>

<p><img alt="Cutting copper" src="images/cutting-copper-2.jpg" /></p>

<p>After cutting out, I bashed the shapes flat as best I could (using the
hammer against the lump hammer in a vice) and filed off the worse sharp bits.
To glue the veneer to the backing plates I screwed the combination to a bit
of scrap wood and clamped:</p>

<p><img alt="Plates, gluing" src="images/plates-gluing.jpg" /></p>

<p>Here's the immediate result:</p>

<p><img alt="Plates, glued" src="images/plates-glued.jpg" /></p>

<p>Next I cleaned up, sanded &amp; oiled the plates.</p>

<p>At this point I noticed my assembly bench could do with tidying:</p>

<p><img alt="bench mess" src="images/bench-mess.jpg" /></p>

<p>After the oil on the guitar body had about 3 days to soak in, I wiped it
clean and left it overnight for the surface layer to soak in a bit more. Then
I gave it a rub-down with beeswax furniture polish, giving it a night in
between to dry up. I then lined the cavities with thin copper foil to screen
them. I also gave the scratchplate and control panel a coat of wax polish.</p>

<p>Now it was time to think about putting the thing back together again. Here
are the component parts:</p>

<p><img alt="Dissembled" src="images/dissembled.jpg" /></p>

<p>I started by fitting the neck &amp; bridge, which allowed me to make a
first check that the plates would still fit:</p>

<p><img alt="trial assembly" src="images/assembley-test-1.jpg" /></p>

<p>This looked ok, so next came the wiring. The Fender instructions weren't
much help:</p>

<p><img alt="Fender Lace wiring" src="images/fender-lace-wiring.jpg" /></p>

<p>Luckily the switch was self-explanatory:</p>

<p><img alt="Switch" src="images/switch.jpg" /></p>

<p>When I'd attached the switch, volume pot. and jack socket to the modified
control plate I discovered it didn't fit the cavity any more. Out with the
carving tools:</p>

<p><img alt="Cavity rework" src="images/cavity-rework.jpg" /></p>

<p>The same thing happened with the pickups, I had to trim a millimetre or
two off the ends of the cavities to get them to fit without straining.
Getting the wires through the small hole between the pickup cavity and the
scratchplate cavity was a nightmare (again). Once fitted I tested the
everything by fitting just one string and twanging into a little amp. I'd got
the pickup phase right first time, although something kept shorting in the
control cavity, so after spending ages trying to apply bits of insulating
tape to the possible culprits I wound up pulling out the screening foil from
that cavity altogether. May have to revisit if it hums too much (it
shouldn't, there's not much exposed wire and the panel now has its copper
layer which is grounded).</p>

<p>After all this I put on some new strings. Here's what the fitted pickups
look like:</p>

<p><img alt="Pickups" src="images/pickups.jpg" /></p>

<p>Here's the rearranged control plate in situ (sorry about the blur, I'll
replace this later). Bridge would be bottom-left, so the switch is now nearest my picking hand (the near-vertical angle of that feels a bit weird, but the general position seems ok and I should get used to it soon enough) :</p>

<p><img alt="control plate" src="images/control-plate.jpg" /></p>

<p>I hadn't had to do anything with the tuners (machine heads), although gave
them a gratuitous wipe with gun oil. As I was stringing up I was thinking how
convenient the locking screws were on them. You push the string through as
usual, then tighten the thumbscrew at the back and snip the excess string
before tuning up. I should have kept my mind on what I was doing, because I
made a little boo-boo which needed a clunky workaround (you can also see the
cleaned-up nut here) :</p>

<p><img alt="strings crossed" src="images/strings-crossed.jpg" /></p>

<p>Now came the moment of truth, plugging it into the proper amp and trying
it out. It worked a treat. I haven't yet got around to final adjustments of
the bridge, but with the way I had it set before it's approximately right.
The Fender Lace Sensor pickup was a success, sounded great. Its output was
quite a bit lower than the other two pickups but I was able to adjust the
relative pickup heights enough to get a reasonable balance.</p>

<p>So, finally here are the three different assembled stages </p>
