<p><em>I wrote some of this as I went along, some of it after I'd finished, so
the tense hops around a bit.</em></p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>I got my first electric guitar as a teenager, though never learned how to
play it (wasn't so necessary for the punk at the time). Over the following
years I got through another two or three, but then didn't have one for at least
a decade, until last year. Then we bought a cheap Squier Strat from the shop in
Lucca, along with a bass for Caroline and a couple of combo amps. For the price
the Squier was remarkably good, but I wasn't really satisfied with the sound. I
swapped out the pickups and spent quite a bit of time playing with wiring
combinations. This made a huge difference, but there was still a weak link -
the body. The Squier has a much thinner body than a regular Strat. I don't know
what kind of wood they're made from but I'm fairly sure it's built up from
smaller blocks. The net effect is that it seems to act on the overall response
like a flannel.</p>

<p>A few months ago I inherited a source of interesting wood, so decided to
start another guitar more or less from scratch. I have very little woodworking
experience (a bit of carving) so decided to leave the hardest part to the
expert machines - I bought a replacement Strat neck from StewMac. I bought the
hardware too, I'm not remotely equipped for metal machining and haven't the
patience for pickup winding. What's left is body construction and assembly.
Here are some photos of the process I went through, some are a bit blurry I'm
afraid - the cheap HP camera has focus issues. </p>

<h3>(Old) Current Status</h3>

<p>Here's as far as I've got. It works, feels good, sounds great. It's not yet
finished, but I'm going to leave is a month or so in this state to try it out,
and let it settle. Amongst other things I expect to have to do a little more
contouring before finishing the body, probably with oil &amp; wax. I expect the
body to go quite a bit darker and hopefully for the grain to stand out more,
with the scratchplate/control panel being virtually the same colour (they're
made from the same wood as the body itself).</p>

<p><img src="images/vinocaster-pre-finish.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>It's called the Vinocaster because it's made from wood reclaimed from a wine
vat (tino), the one on the right in the picture below. It was left in the
cantina in our new/old house. Achille, who's barrel it was reckoned it was
chestnut (castagna) - I'm not 100% sure, it might be oak. Oak is the
traditional barrel wood, but given that we live in a chestnut forest
(Garfagnana) it's a distinct possibility. In appearance, when prepared, the
local oak and chestnut wood is fairly indistinguishable. The reason I have any
doubts is that in some places in the barrel woodworm had tunnelled quite deep.
Chestnut is very high in tannin, and most old wood only has fairly surface worm
attack. </p>

<p>Neither chestnut or oak is exactly known as a tone wood, but I assumed that
given the hardness of the stuff, if I made the body suitably thick then it
would worst case be rigid. It's worth noting that Fender's early designs were
based largely on wood availability and ease of (factory) construction - two of
my considerations.</p>

<p>My priorities were for sound and playability, appearance being well down the
list. While most guitars aimed at being ergonomic tend to be lightweight, I
actually wanted to go the other way, I feel more comfortable playing something
with a bit of mass. I opted for a Stratocaster shape in part because I had the
Squier to use as a guide, but mostly because I think Fender happened to hit on
a remarkably good design.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/tini.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>I could have used the bottom of the barrel for the body, but decided (this
time around at least) to use the staves. These were not only thinner and
narrower than required, but also bent. A <em>lot</em> of time went into
preparing these.</p>

<p>I don't seem to have a photo of the exact pieces I used for the body, but I
cleaned up quite a few more for future use (thinking maybe window frames and
furniture). Here's one of the staves from the older barrels prior to
clean-up:</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/stave-raw.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>I cut these particular ones in half lengthwise because they were too bent to
be much in full. The first bit of cleanup I did with a mallet and old chisel.
The inside of the barrels was covered in a purple encrustation. I'm not sure if
that was just grape residue or they'd been lined with a bit of gesso. It tasted
of gravel. </p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/stave-gouge.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>After getting the worst grolly off, I used an electric plane to partially
level and smooth the surfaces. Messy.</p>

<p><img src="images/staves-planer.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>With the pieces for the guitar I improvised a pair of tracks for the router
so I could get at least one side flat. I'm completely inexperience with a
router so ended up having to use a hand plane to clean up. I'd handplaned one
edge square and flat, cut the width on the bandsaw and used the plane again to
smooth the other edge. It sounds a lot more straightforward than it was - I
went round and round on this, the bend of the staves was really persistent.</p>

<p>Early on I'd also made up a plywood template of the body shape, traced on
paper from the Squier then cut out with the bandsaw, perimeter finished off
with hand tools. Once I'd got the edges and one face of the staves flat I next
glued them edge to edge.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/template-gluing.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>I'd decided to use epoxy resin for glue, and the best that was available
from the nearest hardware shop was 48 hr setting, grey-coloured. Appearance was
a low priority and I was fairly sure the joins would match well enough that it
wouldn't be a real eyesore. I got one side of the pieces as flat as I could,
and clamped against some thick flat plywood.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/gluing.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>I was aiming for 2 inch thickness all over to start with, so needed two
layers. The best faces produced from the edge gluing were fairly flat, a little
hand smoothing got them good enough for me. Then I glued the two flats
face-to-face.</p>

<p></p>

<p><img src="images/gluing-layers.jpg" alt="photo"> </p>

<p>The result wasn't perfect, but I was very happy.</p>

<p><img src="images/glued.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>After planing the outside surfaces more level, I used the bandsaw to roughly
cut out the shape.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/body-raw.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>Thickness was about right. </p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/thickness.jpg" alt="photo"> <br>
<img src="images/body-template.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>The staves appeared like they'd come from fairly small trees/branches, I
thought it probably best to line them up as in the offcut from the end.</p>

<p>The way I'd planned it was for four parallel lengths across the front, five
across the back. The idea being that the centre length on the back would act as
a solid spine, parallel to the run of the strings.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/grain.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>This is a lot thicker than the Squier.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/thickness-compared.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>I couldn't get a narrow bandsaw blade locally so I just did my best with
what I had, making lots of straight cuts into curves before cutting them.
Although the edge surface came out really uneven and scorched quite a bit, the
bandsaw was still a brilliant timesaver. </p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/bandsawed.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>I then cleaned up the edges a bit with gouges and a spokeshave (an antique
wooden one I had - I'd have bought a new steel one if any of the shops around
here had stocked them). Time to start thinking about attaching the neck.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/layout.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>I roughed out the neck pocket by eye with the router, with a couple of
fences to be on the safe side. The fences were a marvellous find in a hardware
shop - they're rectangular tubes of aluminium, dead straight, intended for
something like curtain rails (not sure).</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/neck-socket-rough.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>Seemed to me the best way of getting a good fit on the neck was to use it to
put guides in place for the router. I'd got a router bit with bearings on it
which could run directly along the edge of the aluminium bits (photo below).</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/neck-pocket-templating.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>Despite taking time over this, my inexperience with the router showed, I
messed up the inner edge a bit and the bottom was fairly uneven.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/neck-pocket.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>But the sides (which would have been the hardest part to fix) came out spot
on. Very snug fit.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/neck-pocket-trial.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>I then checked the alignment, taping the bridge in place and putting on a
couple of strings.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/neck-trial.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>Not bad at all. The bridge I'd bought allows some sideways adjustment of the
string positions, so I was delighted to see the alignment was easily close
enough.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/neck-trial-strings.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>Because the body was still 2" thick, I routed down an area on the other side
(to 1.75") to take the fixing plate. I placed the back plate in the pocket to
position the screw holes, drilling through from that side. The drill bit broke
in the wood on the last hole. That caused a lot of grief.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/neck-pocket-rear-raw.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>A significant amount of cursing later, I had the neck attached.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/neck-pocket-fitted-rear.jpg" alt="photo"> <br>
<img src="images/neck-fitted-raw.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>Next I moved on to routing holes in the front for the pickup (I decided to
try just the one at first) and controls. Again I roughed out the hole by eye.
I'd bought templates from StewMac, held down with double-sided tape (which
worked well).</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/pickup-routing.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>The bearings are meant to run against the template, the blade cutting the
edge of the wood exactly in line. That's the idea, but again I was a bit
clumsy, somehow trimmed a chunk out of the template.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/pickup-routing-action.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>The result was fine though, after I realised that I'd not taken the
thickness of the template into account when setting the cutter depth.</p>

<p>Because I wasn't sure quite how I wanted the controls, I made a hole to
match the Strat's jack socket plate. For starters I'd use a regular jack socket
and a single volume pot mounted in that area. </p>

<p>I then used an absurdly long drill bit to make a hole from the pickup to the
control recess.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/long-drill.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>Next I made a temporary scratchplate and control front panel from flat
plastic. Once done, I attached the rest of the hardware and wired up the
pickup. It took a while but was relatively straightforward. Remarkably the
action hardly needed any adjustment. Glee. </p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/assembled-1-compared.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>I then plugged it in and gave it a twiddle. </p>

<p>The pickup I'd chosen for the bridge was a TV Jones Magna'Tron in a regular
humbucker-shaped mount. I'd been very worried this might have been a mistake
because I'd not really thought it through before ordering. For a start I didn't
need to have chosen the humbucker mount, I was making the hole into which it
would sit after all (their standard mount looks a lot cooler, boo). But more
importantly the Magna'Tron has fixed pole pieces, if the volume balance across
the strings was out I'd be out of luck. </p>

<p>But TV Jones is known for magic, and this thing Just Worked. The sound was
wonderful. More glee.</p>

<p>My favourite sound from the Squier was a mix of the bridge &amp; middle
pickups, I left the switch there most of the time. When I did an A-B test
against the Squier the nearest sound to the Vinocaster (which now had earned a
name) was with that bridge &amp; middle configuration. What's more the timbre
seemed that much richer somehow, and actually better balanced across the
strings (even though I'd tweaked the Squier a lot).</p>

<p><em>Much glee.</em></p>

<p>Ok, so far so good.</p>

<p>Next I routed recesses for two more pickups (forgot to photograph this bit).
Then I contoured the body using gouges &amp; the spokeshave, and gave it a
basic sanding. I also cut some veneer from the spare barrel wood for
scratchplate and controls, putting a thin layer of epoxy on the back followed
by copper tape. </p>

<p><img src="images/assembled-1-compared-edge.jpg" alt="pre-finish"> </p>

<p><img src="images/wiring.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>The wiring should have been straightforward, had I not ordered the wrong
switch. I wanted a 5-way, I ended up with a 3-way. A bit of file work gave it
the additional positions, but the circuit was another matter. I wanted a
straight neck/neck+middle/middle/middle+bridge/bridge set of options. Can you
see that here?</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/bastard-switch.jpg" alt="photo"> <br>
<img src="images/bastard-switch-whole.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>After a lot of sketching &amp; trial &amp; error I ended up near-enough. If
the switch is fully in the bridge position it's silent, but tweaked a teeny
fraction it works.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/assembled.jpg" alt="photo"> </p>

<p>That one piece on the back looks a bit weird, but should look better after
final sanding &amp; finishing. Not bothered anyhow - it's on the back.</p>

<p><img src="images/assembled-rear.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>For the contours I approximated those of the Squier, with just a little more
off the lower bout where my right arm rests. </p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/assembled-edge.jpg" alt="photo"> <br>
<img src="images/assembled-angle.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>It still needs cleaing up, but I am so pleased with that neck joint.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/assembled-neck-pocket.jpg" alt="photo"> </p>

<p></p>

<p>I think I've made a minor error with the machine heads. It seems these
Sperzel locking tuners are actually of different heights, and low enough that
string trees aren't needed (I used some fancy roller string trees, what the
heck).</p>

<p><img src="images/head.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>The white pickups are Seymour Duncans, a Duckbucker in the middle, Cool
Rails in the neck. I had these plus a Lil'59 (pseudo-Gibson humbucker sound) on
the Squier, left that behind because I already have a real humbucker. The Cool
Rails gives a mellow, vaguely Strat-ish sound, very Jazz. The Duckbucker sounds
very Strat but I'm not sure whether I'll leave it there - it's low output
compared with the others, and in combination it pulls down the combined level
(I suspect its coils are wired in parallel, but I think there were only 2 wires
available).</p>

<p>The scratch/pickup plate wasn't intended to be so blocky, it started with
'ears' extending up the sides of the neck-end. But I cut the line across the
cut-out the wrong place and it looked terrible, so I dispatched the ears. (It
still remains to be seen whether the material I've used for these panels will
be durable enough, could well end up changing). </p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/assembled-pickups.jpg" alt="photo"> </p>

<p>The Sperzel roller bridge I'd chosen because it took the strings through its
end, and not through the body. As it happens it's a nice thing in other ways -
very solid feeling, and the rollers can be moved side-to-side in addition to
the usual height/intonation adjustments.</p>

<p>As well as the deep contouring on the left of the lower bout, the whole
front has a slight slope (3/16" at most) from the middle (on the perimeter of
the the pickup/bridge area) to the edges.</p>

<p><img src="images/assembled-front.jpg" alt="photo"> <br>
<img src="images/assembled-doneish.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p></p>

<p>The nut needed work, it was way too high. I think I've got it pretty close
now, very careful file &amp; knife work.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/nut-rough.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>I've not got the setup optimal just yet, but the action is great.</p>

<p></p>

<p><img src="images/assembled-action.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>I may well redo the control panel, not just because it's layout is a bit
wonky. I still think the knob is too close to the playing area of the strings.
That's the biggest design flaw of the Strat IMHO, the controls are in the way.
It feels much better having open space all around that area.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/assembled-controls.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>The control placement isn't very good for the stand either, but I think I'll
leave it there.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="images/pre-finish.jpg" alt="photo"></p>

<p>So aside from minor adjustements now I'm going to leave it bare a month or
so to play and see if any changes are needed, especially to the contouring.</p>
