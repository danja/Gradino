<H3 align=center>1st July 2003<BR></H3>
<H2><B>Main Application</B></H2>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG height=557 
src="IdeaGraph screenshots, 1st July 2003_files/screenshot-1.gif" width=792></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The primary user interface is a window containing sub-windows. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>All working buttons (should) have mouse-over hints.</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The three most interesting windows provide views of the data at different 
levels of granularity. The<B> Perspectives </B>window deals with top-level, 
system- and project- wide views. The <B>IdeaGraph Editor</B> window is used for 
the diagrams, which are comprised of<I><B> Ideas</B></I> (which are the red 
rectangles) and <I><B>Connections</B></I> (the lines between the rectangles). To 
keep things simple these diagrams are called <I><B>IdeaGraphs</B></I>. The 
<B>Idea</B> window is used to provide the main details for each idea (node) in 
the IdeaGraph. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Double-clicking on the <B>IdeaGraph Editor </B>window creates a new<B> 
Idea</B>. Single-clicking on an <B>Idea</B> makes that <B>Idea</B> the focus of 
the<B> Idea</B> window. Double-clicking an <B>Idea</B> opens the<B> Document 
Editor </B>window (see below)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>The <I>NEW</I> Way Connections are Drawn</B><A name=relchange></A></P>
<P>When you move the mouse cursor over an idea it will initially change to an 
arrow. But if you move the arrow over the centre of the idea then the cursor 
will change to a hand shape. Clicking and dragging now allows you to draw the 
relationship lines between the ideas.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If a connection (arc) is clicked on, a different window appears in place of 
the<B> Idea</B> window :</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG height=82 
src="IdeaGraph screenshots, 1st July 2003_files/connection.gif" width=261></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The connection can anything you like, but connections from existing 
vocabularies may be selected from the menus. Other vocabularies can be loaded 
using the <B>Vocabs</B> tab in the <B>Perspectives</B> window. Once loaded they 
will show as additional menus here.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><I><B>RDF Geek Note</B> : that may be read as RDF Properties from existing 
ontologies, custom user input is recorded as a property in an RDF Schema in a 
custom namespace. </I></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><I><B>User Interface Geek Note</B>: the creation of nodes and arcs is fairly 
non-standard, but most standard tools use a fixed toolbar. If you hit the 
</I><B>F11</B><I> key in IdeaGraph you have the full screen in which to work on 
the diagram. It only takes a few minutes to get used to, and no trip to a 
toolbar is needed.</I></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Other info is available from the <B>Idea</B> window :</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG height=458 
src="IdeaGraph screenshots, 1st July 2003_files/item-meta.gif" width=315></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><I>Elephant's Note : In the prototype I had a lot more variation in the views 
of the nodes in the graph : shapes, images, colors. These will be back in time 
for version 1.0.</I></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Double-clicking an <B>Idea</B> in the <B>IdeaGraph Editor</B> window opens 
the<B> Document Editor </B>window :</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Returning to the<B> Perspectives</B> window, it has some interesting (and not 
so interesting) tabs :</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG height=248 src="IdeaGraph screenshots, 1st July 2003_files/project.gif" 
width=303></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The <B>Project</B> and <B>Channels</B> window display tree for managing 
projects and syndicated channel feeds respectively. </P>
<P><I>Geek Note : RSS feeds are pre-processed with XSLT</I></P>
<P><I>I messed up a bit of the code here. These will be friendlier!!</I></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG height=248 
src="IdeaGraph screenshots, 1st July 2003_files/perspectives.gif" width=299></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The <B>Vocabs</B> tab is for managing vocabularies, both existing ones and 
ones you have created yourself.</P>
<P>This still needs a lot of work.</P>
<P><I>Geek Note : I'll probably use another RDF tree component here too. The bit 
below was a start at separating a friendly version of each properties 
(rdfs:label) and the internal representation (rdf:Property)</I></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG height=468 src="IdeaGraph screenshots, 1st July 2003_files/vocabs.gif" 
width=297></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The<B> Settings </B>tab is for project, user and system configuration :</P>
<P><I>Geek Note : Bit crude at the moment, but all the config stuff is stored in 
RDF files.</I></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG height=358 src="IdeaGraph screenshots, 1st July 2003_files/settings.gif" 
width=298></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The <B>Command</B> tab is for command-line operations. This is presently 
rather geeky, though the plan is to also enable simple commands to be entered 
here to manipulate the <B>IdeaGraph</B>s.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><I>Geek Note : this stuff's pretty cool. Python's built on Jython, Prolog's 
home-spun.</I></P>
<P>There are two tabs, <B>Prolog </B>and<B> Python</B>, each corresponding to an 
interpreter in that language.</P>
<P>Here a Python command is used to display a serialization of the simple 
<B>IdeaGraph. </B>Existing source files can be loaded and executed using the 
buttons (they have mouseover tooltips).</P>
<P><I>Geek note : see what I mean - but it gets better...</I></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG height=557 src="IdeaGraph screenshots, 1st July 2003_files/python.gif" 
width=792></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This is very much experimentation-in-progress, but currently the Prolog 
engine has a separate knowledgebase, which can be populated from the data in the 
IdeaGraph's RDF model. You can then manipulate that knowledge, e.g. 
filter-by-retraction, and then push the knowledge base back out to another 
IdeaGraph diagram. There is a file with the IdeaGraph distro 
(<I>ideagraph\data\prolog</I> somewhere) which contains some of the RDF(S) 
axioms, but most are commented out because it soon goes into a loop - tabling 
isn't yet implemented. There are some other comments <A 
href="http://66.70.191.189/cgi-bin/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1&amp;search=prolog">here</A>.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><I>Non-geek Note : I did warn you!</I></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The buttons have the following functions :</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<UL>
  <LI>load file from disk 
  <LI>save session input data to disk 
  <LI>save screen text to disk 
  <LI>clear screen and input history 
  <LI>load NTriples file from disk 
  <LI>load data from diagram 
  <LI>send data to diagram </LI></UL>
<P><IMG height=557 src="IdeaGraph screenshots, 1st July 2003_files/prolog.gif" 
width=792></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><I>Geek Note : the Prolog interpreter, Java and Jython all share the same VM, 
so exactly the same object instances can be worked on with any of the three 
languages. A simple example of this can be seen <A 
href="http://dannyayers.com/archives/001368.html">here</A></I></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The parts of IdeaGraph in the screenshots so far have been related to core 
functionality. There are a few things that you might want to do around the 
fringes that call for external tools. Bare-bones versions of the obvious tools 
will also be provided :</P>
