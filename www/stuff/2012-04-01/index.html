<p></p>

<p>Yep, as you've no doubt guess, I made it up. For my own ref. as much as
anything else I thought I'd write down how.</p>

<p>Some months ago I happened to notice a similarity between <a

Division</a> (that's a much funnier video, btw). I do <a

particular night I was lacking inspiration so decided to play with those
tracks. I tried singing the lyrics of the former over the latter, but it didn't
work, the words are a bit too fragmented. But as I'd got everything set up I
wondered what else might fit, ideally something as different from Joy Division
as possible. Obviously, <a
